- Simple earthquake viewer website made with Vite using USGS API.
- It uses Leaflet to show earthquakes on an interactable map.
- You can also see earthquakes marked with a warning icon, indicating a tsunami warning.


 - You can take references from this project or use it as a template, but please credit me if so.
You can deploy this using Vercel or Netlify.
Contributions are welcome!
